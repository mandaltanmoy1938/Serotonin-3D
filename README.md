# Serotonin-3D
A 3D model of Serotonin is created using Blender-v3.2.0 and [FreeCAD-asm3-Daily-Win64-Py3-Qt5-20220430](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/releases).

The serotonin model is created first in FreeCAD_assembly3.
Then the exported meshed model from FreeCAD is imported to Blender for further modelling 
   - adding carbon fiber texture
   - lighting for led

Following is the rendered image from blender
